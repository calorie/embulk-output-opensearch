### Modes

#### insert:

default.
This mode writes data to existing index.

#### replace:

1. Create new temporary index
2. Insert data into the new index
3. replace the alias with the new index. If alias doesn't exists, plugin will create new alias.
4. Delete existing (old) index if exists

Index should not exists with the same name as the alias

```yaml
out:
  type: opensearch
  mode: replace
  nodes:
  - {host: localhost, port: 9200}
  index: <alias name> # plugin generates index name like <index>_%Y%m%d-%H%M%S
```

### Authentication

This plugin supports Basic authentication.
'Security' also supports LDAP and Active Directory. This plugin doesn't supports these auth methods.

```yaml
use_ssl: true
auth_method: basic
user: <username>
password: <password>
```

## Example

```yaml
out:
  type: opensearch
  mode: insert
  nodes:
  - {host: localhost, port: 9200}
  index: <index name>
```

## Test

Firstly install Docker and Docker compose then `docker compose up opensearch`,
so that an ES server will be locally launched then you can run tests with `docker compose run --rm java ./gradlew test`.

```sh
docker compose up opensearch
docker compose run --rm java ./gradlew test  # -t to watch change of files and rebuild continuously
```

For Maintainers
----------------

### Release

Modify `version` in `build.gradle` at a detached commit, and then tag the commit with an annotation.

```sh
git checkout --detach main
# (Edit: Remove "-SNAPSHOT" in "version" in build.gradle.)
git add build.gradle
git commit -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git tag -a vX.Y.Z
# (Edit: Write a tag annotation in the changelog format.)
```

See [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) for the changelog format. We adopt a part of it for Git's tag annotation like below.

```
## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
### Added
- Added a feature.
### Changed
- Changed something.
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug.
```

Push the annotated tag, then. It triggers a release operation on GitHub Actions after approval.

```sh
git push -u origin vX.Y.Z
```
